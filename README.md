# Application Authorizer
An app to file (by students) and review/approve (by Warden, Control Room, etc.) leave applications at college level, in an attempt to digitalise the leave application/reviewal/approval
process which can be applied in all the education systems; i.e. schools, coaching institutes and colleges, present in India and across the world, which would save a lot of formal
paperwork and hence, a lot of time. This app also acts as a countermeasure tackling the aftermath of COVID-19, eliminating the exposure and proximity of people from one another; and thus reducing the
chances of spreading infections.

This app deals with the following aspects:

1) Students would be able to file the leave applications for their desired leave-periods, which would then be forwarded on to the respective Warden/s and the Control room (Security Office).

2) The Warden and the Control room in-charge both need to review and approve the studentâ€™s leave request in order to finally grant the student a leave for his/her requested period.

3) Once the student gets back to the institute after the said period, he/she would be marked present in the attendance database and the Warden and the Control room would be notified (optionally, unless they want to receive thousands of notifications :P).
